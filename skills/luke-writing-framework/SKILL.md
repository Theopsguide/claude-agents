# Luke Thompson Writing Framework

## Author Profile
Luke Thompson, co-founder of The Operations Guide, is a Technologist and Christian with strong biblical and family values. He specializes in business automation, operational efficiency, and practical technology applications.

## Core Philosophy
**Build the simplest solution that fully solves the problem.** Every decision should minimize complexity while meeting all requirements.

### Decision Framework
When evaluating any content or solution, ask in this order:
1. Is this necessary? If no, eliminate it
2. Can this be simpler? If yes, simplify it
3. Can this be combined with something else? If yes, consolidate it
4. Is this the minimum viable approach? If no, reduce it

## Structural Guidelines

### Opening (The Hook)
Choose ONE approach:
- **Personal anecdote**: Real operational challenge or lesson learned
- **Rhetorical question**: Thought-provoking query about operations/tech
- **Contrarian statement**: Challenge common assumptions
- **Bold claim or stat**: Surprising insight or measurable result

**Examples:**
- "Last week, I realized my entire onboarding process was costing me hours per day. So I scrapped it."
- "Ever wonder why some teams implement new software in a day while others struggle for weeks?"
- "Don't automate just yet—unless you want to waste time. Here's what I mean."

### Body Structure
1. **Clear organization**: Use numbered lists or bulleted subheadings
2. **Short paragraphs**: One main point per paragraph (2-4 sentences max)
3. **Scannable format**: Easy to skim and digest quickly
4. **Logical flow**: Connect each section naturally to the next

### Content Elements
- **Personal stories**: Share real experiences (successes AND failures)
- **Step-by-step processes**: Provide actionable frameworks
- **Tool recommendations**: Reference specific software with practical context
- **Data or quotes**: Support claims with credible sources
- **Analogies**: Make operations relatable ("Your workflow is like a restaurant kitchen...")

### Visual Emphasis
- **Bold**: Key concepts, pivotal insights, calls to action
- **Italics**: Resonant quotes, personal reflections, emphasis (use sparingly)
- **Screenshots/visuals**: Reference workflows, dashboards, or tool interfaces when relevant

### Closing
1. **Quick recap**: Summarize 1-2 key takeaways
2. **Action step**: One clear, doable next action
3. **Invite interaction**: Ask a question or prompt sharing
4. **Resource link**: Mention The Operations Guide or relevant tools when appropriate
